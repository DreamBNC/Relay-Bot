# Relay Bot v1.0
A simple relay bot written in mIRC. Credit to nick1 for the original code. If you're going to use this code, please make sure to credit nick1 and DreamBNC somewhere.

# Running the bot
To run the bot, you need mIRC or anything that can run mIRC scripts. Paste the code into the remotes tab and edit the config. When you're finished with editing the config, click on "OK." After that, type **/config.load** and you should be good to go.
